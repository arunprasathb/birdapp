They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length. Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5 cm (2.0 in) bee hummingbird weighing less than 2.0 g (0.07 oz).They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings which flap at high frequencies audible to humans. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species, to in excess of 80 in some of the smallest. Of those species that have been measured in wind tunnels, their top speed exceeds 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph) and some species can dive at speeds in excess of 22 m/s (79 km/h; 49 mph).', 'imageUrl'=>'http://18.222.200.228/sample/images/books/book2.png'/*, 'paidPdfUrl' => 'http://18.222.200.228/sample/images/books/files/sample.pdf'*/, 'font_style'=> "Italic", 'unpaidPdfUrl'=>'http://18.222.200.228/sample/images/books/files/sample.pdf', 'author'=> "Roger Tory Peterson"),
